I finally wrapped up my Master's degree with a thesis called [**Fast Typesetting with Incremental Compilation**](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mhaug/fast-typesetting-incremental-compilation.pdf).

In it, I present an incremental parser for context-sensitive languages, and apply and evaluate it on a markup language for typesetting. I also show a constraint- and memoization-based optimization for typesetting. Both contributions are evaluated within the context of [Typst,](https://typst.app/) a new markup-based typesetting system I am a co-founder of. The incremental layouting algorithms described in the thesis have since been [iterated on.](https://laurmaedje.github.io/posts/comemo/)

This work will continue at Typst, so follow my startup if you'd like to see more.
